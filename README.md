# SVC AudioSplitter
SVS Audio splitter is a program for splitting audio files into chunks of 10 (this can be changed) seconds. 10 seconds is the recommended time to train [so-vits-svc-fork AI](https://github.com/voicepaw/so-vits-svc-fork). Unfortunately, to avoid complications in its installation, it can only work with wav files, but if your folder contains files of other extensions, you can use a bat file that will change all your extensions to .wav. 
Please note that the bat file does not convert files to another format, but simply renames them, which can cause problems. If you have such problems, use any third-party converter.
